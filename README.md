# JavaScript-week-3
E-commerce Project


The home page contains a series of CSS code that I implemented while keeping in mind Design thinking and the Dont Make me think Book, taking care of the trailing that the user can follow to get to the main point. Buying pizza.
Learned a new component such as Transform, and preserve 3d in CSS. As we are exiting the HTML and CSS small part of the course, I have not just exceeded my own expectations but show case my capability with Cascading Styling Sheets.

As for the Product page, Initially you are welcome with a pleasant view of the page and produces, with a 6x2 grid, and a hover effect on top of the items to bring up the website to life. 
My grid Items were specifically collected from a JSON file and Place in the HTML website through a back end code in JavaScript, thus allowing me to take my first step to Fetching data from a data base (excuse the redundancy). Continuing to analyzing the website you are met with a search bar, that serves as a Filter method for the Products. 

To continue with the Website tour, we are heading to the Contact page. I have to say, I utilized my own resources from previous project elements I have created, and was able to use that with today's Assignment. With a simple touch of creativity, I made the contact page have a professional and simple look. I give the User the ability to input their Name, Email, and a Comment. I implemented an alert incase someone tries to be annonimous, users have to write a name, and a validator for the email portion, so the user enter a valid form of email.

To keep up with all this changes, I decided to be for persice and organized with my work, and created a separate CSS file for, Footer, Header, @query, Animation.
This allowed me to become more efficient with my work, and have far less issues at the time of coding across webpages.
In addition to this, I have created 2 main media query, Iphone 375px, and Ipad Mini 800px. Also met the requirements by creating a Min and Max portions on the query to have better view and Responsivenes.

In conclusion, I was able to concise everything I learned in class and on my own, I also created good coding practice for myself, to keep a cleaner, sophisticated, and remarkable work. 
There is no better way to finish this than to say, I am Impress by my own work and hope to have impressed you too.
